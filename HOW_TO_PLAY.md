# How to play
## General
In this game you have to build and expand your village by strategically placing one of **7 buildings** on the map.
When you first enter the game, the only thing you can do is to **build a house**. After that you will see your first building and a **white outlined area**. This area is called **zone**. All of your following actions can be done **only inside the zone**. Every building **expands** your zone, so you may go further.
Inside the zone you can place buildings according to the **placement rules**. Buildings cost you **wood** and **stone**.
## UI
### Resources
In the **topleft** corner you have the **resource bars**. **Top** bar represents the **wood**, **bottom** one represents the **stone**. Hover your cursor over the bars to see the **exact amount**.
### Clock
In the **topright** corner you have the **clock** that shows current time. The number you see above the line is how many **in-game days** you have played for. Hover your cursor over the clock to see the **exact time**.
### Hotbar
At the **bottom** you have the **hotbar** that shows all types of buildings. Selected item is outlined with **white rectangle**. When you change the mode, a **text message** appears above the hotbar. It shows the **name** of an item and **how many** of it you can build.
